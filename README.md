# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my EDA project! This repository contains detailed Exploratory Data Analysis performed on a dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, and prepare it for machine learning or statistical modeling.

## 🧠 About the Projects

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis to:
- Explore the dataset’s structure and contents
- Identify and handle missing values and outliers
- Visualize distributions and relationships between features
- Gain meaningful insights to guide future modeling and decision-making

EDA is a crucial step before building any model, and this project reflects how I approach data with curiosity, logic, and a bit of creativity. 🙂
